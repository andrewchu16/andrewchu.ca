                As I stroll through the snowy streets of my neighbourhood, I admire the different
                houses, often wondering how it reflects the people living inside. Perhaps it's a
                family of four, a couple growing old together, or someone living alone peacefully
                amongst their presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                I now stand at the front door of my own house, built of red bricks and covered by a
                dark gray roof now lined with fluffy white snow. And just past that door tells the
                story of my almost 16 years of existence.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the living room, there sits an armchair with menacing googly eyes and a mile-long
                smile spreading across the back cushion. As I walk towards it, I can almost hear it
                saying “Ho, you're approaching me?”, remembering that time I leaped from the couch
                to that chair and slipped.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the stairs, I see my younger self carrying my little dolls and necklaces, and my
                sister telling me to be careful, or else I'd fall. One can only guess what happened
                next.
            </p>

                There's a tree in the family room that used to tower over my small self, as I
                struggled with all my might to reach the lowest branch. Now, it is reduced to the
                stem leaning against the wall and drooping brown leaves in the dark corner of the
                room.
            </p>
            <p>
                And in that very room, there is a piano with stacks of our sheet music across the
                ten years that my sister and I each spent practising almost every day. I only hope
                our sound resonates deep within this house and through the roots of our dying
                plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                I walk across the scratched floorboards that were damaged from my sister's birthday
                party some years ago. I see the glass dining table on its last legs, where many ice
                cream birthday cakes have been cut. In the hall on the second floor, I remember a
                younger me dropping my sister's precious piggy bank in front of her very eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I turn my gaze to my room, my safe space, my creative studio, my personal concert
                stadium. The door that used to have a Taylor Swift poster plastered against it (for
                no reason at all, really), now replaced by posters and photocards of my favourite
                K-pop group. My dollhouse wears a veil of plastic over it, and my toys are stuffed
                into boxes, but everything is still there. I use the same floral pattern duvet cover
                and Rilakkuma pillow cases from 2012. And I remember that desk being built on a
                Monday that one time I stayed home sick in grade 2. It's the same desk I write my
                short stories, sketch, and draw on.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a room stained with tears. I would sob into my blankets wishing I was a
                better daughter or a better friend or a better student. But at the same time, it's a
                room of self-discovery, having fun with hobbies, and relaxing after a long day of
                school work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I often say, “I can't wait to get out of here,” as I fantasize about what it would
                be like to live in a different city or even country by myself – where I am my own
                boss, and I can play games for as long as I want. But sometimes I stop and think
                maybe I can wait. Maybe, if only for a moment, I can cherish all the memories – both
                good and bad – and savour as much as I can before I go out and make new ones. I'd
                like to think I have plenty of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, I'll be standing at my front door, hesitating to knock for fear that I will
                be met with an unfamiliar face asking my business there. Although, it warms my heart
                knowing that someone may start a new chapter of their lives here, making tender
                memories as I have.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps the house will remember the slips and falls, the echoing laughter, and the
                many winters passing by, as I too start a new chapter of my life.
